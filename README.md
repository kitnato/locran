# LOCRAN

The LOCRAN (LOcation, CReature, Artifact, Name) system generates a pseudo-random variety of names for different irreverent fantasy-themed wildernesses, items and monsters.

At its core is JSON library of (loosely) fantasy-world-themed words is the basis for the generation and composition of (somewhat) coherent names for locations, creatures, artifacts or unique monster names. Parameters for tags and affix composition can be passed to make the generation more specific. If profanity is toggled on, the names may also be pornographic.
